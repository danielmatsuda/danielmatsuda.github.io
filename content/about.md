# About

Hello! I'm a post-baccalaureate Computer Science student at Oregon State University. I'm interested in backend development.

My first Bachelor's degree was a BA in Asian Studies from Carleton College. Here, I was first exposed to programming in Python and R. After a short but unforgettable stint as a translator in rural Japan, I enrolled full-time at Oregon State to study computer science.

Besides foreign languages and software, I also love modern hip-hop dance and baking cheesecake.
