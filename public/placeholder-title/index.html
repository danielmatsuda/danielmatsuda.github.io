<h1 id="1-the-thirty-minute-rule">1. The Thirty-Minute Rule</h1>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m pretty sure that this fear of looking dumb is the biggest barrier to becoming a great engineer. I&rsquo;m not smart enough to be cocky.</li>
<li>The thirty-minute rule (TODO: briefly explain it) forces me to strike a clear balance between helping myself and getting help from others. It gives me a clear plan to confronting my fear of looking dumb.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="2-asking-good-questions">2. Asking Good Questions</h1>
<ul>
<li>asking good questions is both a &ldquo;soft skill&rdquo; and a technical skill.</li>
<li>I found this article about a month into my first job and I use what I learned every time I ask a technical question now</li>
<li>it&rsquo;s important because it feels like engineer etiquette - if i&rsquo;m going to ask a question in a public channel, it should be 1) something I couldn&rsquo;t figure out on my own or by searching for the answer previous discussions 2) something another engineer can actually answer 3) a question that will unblock me if answered (though this is not required)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="3-kickstarter-engineer-levels">3. Kickstarter Engineer Levels</h1>
<ul>
<li>engineering standards, core competencies, career growth, etc. can vary among companies. But this list gives some general clarity and solid goals for me to reach for.</li>
<li>At my company, the internal docs on engineer levels are a little sparse. Having 1-to-1s with my tech lead(?) is the best way for me to track my growth and get feedback. But this list helps me identify other areas for improvement and gives me one perspective on the fuzzy definition of a &ldquo;good engineer&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="4-on-being-a-senior-engineer">4. On Being a Senior Engineer</h1>
<ul>
<li>I really like this article.</li>
<li>This article showed me that being a senior engineer is not just about technical knowledge and skill, but also technical leadership. Egoless programming, mentoring and supporting other engineers, etc.</li>
<li>For the most part, the seniors at my company seem to practice the things listed here, and I think this does have a big positive impact on the engineering org</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="5-model-behaviour-code-a-three-step-process-for-designing-software">5. Model, Behaviour, Code: a three step process for designing software</h1>
<ul>
<li>a useful high-level guide for laying a solid foundation for a new web app.</li>
<li>When I do my own personal projects, I sometimes get overwhelmed by all the things that need to be done. This article helps me prioritize(?)</li>
<li></li>
