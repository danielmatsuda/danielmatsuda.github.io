  <p>I joined my current company as a junior software engineer without any prior professional experience in tech. When I hit the six-month mark in this job, I wrote down the things I had learned so far.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sharing this list with two groups of people in mind, who I hope can benefit from it:</p>
<ol>
<li>People with no professional experience in tech. Maybe you&rsquo;re currently a student/bootcamper/general career changer, or just got hired (congrats!), and you&rsquo;re wondering what kinds of things you might learn early on.</li>
<li>Experienced developers who need to onboard a completely fresh new hire. You might be curious to know what kinds of skills your new junior might acquire during their first few months.</li>
</ol>
<p>Please keep in mind that this list is specific to my personal experience,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> and only includes the things I feel comfortable with and do on a regular basis. New juniors will start their role with varying levels of knowledge and experience - just think of this as a single data point I&rsquo;m throwing out there.</p>

<p>In my case, I was nearly done with the Oregon State postbaccalaureate Computer Science program, which gave me fundamental computer science knowledge, plus some experience coding in Python, Javascript, C, and Assembly. Outside of that, I had also done two personal projects - <a href="https://github.com/danielmatsuda/japanese_news">an ETL pipeline in Python</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/danielmatsuda/netflix_titles_api">basic REST API in Go</a>, plus a <a href="https://github.com/electricitymaps/electricitymaps-contrib/pull/3578">small open source contribution</a>. I had minimal experience with Django, which my company uses extensively on the backend.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
