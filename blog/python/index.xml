To do this, I made a serverless ETL pipeline that processed 65,000 articles.
This post briefly summarizes my project. You can find all the code in my Github repo. You can also read the longer version of this post here, where I explain my motivations, design decisions, and code in more detail.</description></item><item><title>Japanese News Project</title><link>https://danielmatsuda.github.io/japanese-news-project/</link><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jul 2021 19:00:27 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://danielmatsuda.github.io/japanese-news-project/</guid><description>I made a serverless ETL pipeline to record all the words from 65,000 Japanese news articles. Then, I found the most frequent 5,000 words and visualized them. This post explains why I made the pipeline, how I designed it, and how it works. You can find all the code in my Github repo.
